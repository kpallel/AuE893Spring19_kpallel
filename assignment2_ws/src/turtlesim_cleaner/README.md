Question 1:
The python code circle.py has been written to make the turtle move in a circle.
A linear velocity of 2 m/s and and angular velocity of 2 rad/sec has been considered for the simulation.


Question 2:
The python code square_openloop.py has been written to make the turtle move in a square.
A linear velocity of 0.2 m/s and an angular velocity of 0.2 rad/sec can be given to the turtle.
The turtle completes a full square path and comes to a halt.
The code has been modified so as to compute for any given input of distance and velocity.
